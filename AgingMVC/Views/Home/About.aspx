    <p>
        Most often adults with elderly parents enter into caregiving with an abrupt, often
        medical-related, event such as a fall, stroke, or heart-attack. The caregivers are
        then caught between two lives: one where they respect and care for their elderly
        parents; and the own family life with a job, kids, and the normal demands of daily
        life. This can be a very stressful time for both the care giver and the care recipient.

            What is "Being Prepared"?</h2>
        Just like entering puberty or having children, caring for an elderly loved one is
        a predictable life-stage event that can be anticipated and planned for.
        <h2 style="color: #696969;">
            The Age Ready Program Can Help</h2>
        The Age Ready Program is designed using the transtheoretical model of change, a
        proven model that helps people become informed, formulate a strategy, and act on
        a new, better behavior.
